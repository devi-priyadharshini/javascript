Vs Code Tips: To Execute js file - Cmd: node file.js / ALT + CTRL + N

JS Review:

For asynchronous operations 

    callback, promise and async.

    When there is a sequence of asynchronous operation,
    - using callback results -> Callback hell : callback within callbacks (complicated)
    - using promise -> better approach than callback
    - using async -> more convenient than promise.

Promise

    all - takes array of promises
        - then.() called when all the promises are resolved without any errors.
        - catch() executed when any one of the promises throws error.
             Results of successful promises are not obtained?
